Q. CHECK Equality in strings without using count variable and length of string given.
====================================================================================


suppose a string -> s = 'baababbbaaba'

solution-1
----------
steps : -

1. first convert string to list
2. Then run a for loop 
3. Inside that check if it is 'a' remove that from list AND append 1 at last to that and do same 'b' WITH -1.
3. Then after loop completed, the all items in list becomes 1 and -1.
4. at last add all items in list
5. In the end if sum == 0 then occurance of 'a' and 'b' are equal else not equal.



solution-2
----------
by using count() function we can get as below

s.count('a')==s.count('b')

-> It will return True if occurance of both a and b are same else False




solution-3
----------
by using regex we can find occurance of each characters in a string as below-

len(re.findall("a",s)) == len(re.findall("b", s)) 

-> it will return True if occurance of both a and b are same else False
